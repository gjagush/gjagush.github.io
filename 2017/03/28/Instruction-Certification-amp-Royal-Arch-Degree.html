      <div class="paragraph">
<p>Well, it seems that I finally went and got myself official. As of Saturday (the 25th), I am officially certified by the Grand Lodge of Texas to teach the memory work for degree proficiencies, and the opening of all four lodges (the fourth being the Lodge of Sorrows).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Initially, I drove all the way to Phoenix Lodge in Weatherford. When I got there, just before the forum (degree exemplification and general Q&amp;A) at 9 am, I was asked, "Hey brother! Are you here for the Commandery Work Day?" My confusion must have beeen pretty evident. I quickly explained that I was there for the exam certification, and was then told that it had been postponed to next weekend. The paper copy of the schedule posted up in the dining hall had been the same one as on the PDF I had on my phone; however, the paper version had a correction on it, in pen. The PDF, naturally, did not have this change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, I settled in the hallway, hanging out with some brothers I knew and some brothers that I didn&#8217;t know, chit-chatting about memory work, Commandery, and a few other things. One brother pointed out to me that Krum (and therefore Krum Lodge&#8217;s certification exams) was only an hour and fifteen minutes away. If I hustled, I might still be able to catch the last 20 minutes of the forum, and make it in time for the certification exams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So I hustled!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I managed to get to Krum Lodge and had a great time. I met some District Instructors, members of the Committee on Work, and all sorts of other brothers. One brother had even heard of the podcast that I put out with some of my lodge brothers! The exams went well, and when I left, I was officially "C-certified."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Last night (Monday, March 27) was also pretty eventful. I managed to double-book myself for both Blue Lodge and Royal Arch Chapter. We had four profiencies in two different degrees in Blue Lodge, and I had my Royal Arch degree scheduled! I had to excuse myself before the last EA profiency, because it was time to go to Chapter. I was really bummed about that, because I am usually the examiner during proficiencies, and I was really looking forwards to this Brother delivering his work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Royal Arch degree was absolutely incredible. It was incredibly immersive and I&#8217;m still digesting it. I am looking forwards to the next time - when I can participate in it. I would write more about it, but to be quite honest, I have to let it settle a bit before I can competently talk about it! It&#8217;s got to be one of my favorite degrees so far, though. I might actually like the experience of this one as an initiate even more than the Master&#8217;s degree (although the Entered Apprentice degree still remains my favorite). This was a very physically-involved sort of experience, which I thought was awesome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Super happy with my experience. I even bought a RAM emblem to put on my car! Very psyched to see what happens in Cryptic Council.</p>

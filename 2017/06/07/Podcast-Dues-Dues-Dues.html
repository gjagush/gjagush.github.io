<p><em>COLUMBUS, Ohio - the Northland Masonic Temple has once again been the target of vandalism. Last week, they got hit by bright blue spray-paint graffiti on the back of their lodge and on their front sign. They took a couple of days, cleaned everything up, and began to resume life as normal. It wasn&#8217;t long before the sign was vandalized again. Fortunately, the vandal was witnessed in action, and arrested by police after they managed to stop his vehicle later on. It is believed that the same vandal is behind both incidents. Best of luck, brothers. Maybe it&#8217;s time to invest in cameras and a dog!</em></p>

<p><em>PORTAGE, Wisconsin - Fort Winnebago Lodge #33 had to call in a tow truck from Blystone&#8217;s Towing in order to move their safe! Apparently it was quite the amusing sight. The brothers from Fort Winnebago Lodge are moving down the block to a new temple and had to get some help with the 1-ton safe. Can&#8217;t say we blame them! Best of luck with the rest of the move, brothers.</em></p>

<p><em>Oslo, Norway - My apologies in advance, as I&#8217;m going off of Google Translate due to neither speaking Dansk nor Norshk. a 67-year-old man is being charged with attempted extortion. The victims? One of the lodges that meet in the Freemason&#8217;s Hall at 23 Blegdamsvej in Copenhagen, Denmark. He had filmed their some of their degrees and/or meetings and attemptted to extort them to the tune of 33 million Danish kroener, which is about 5 million USD. My understanding is that this occurred in the Danish Freemason&#8217;s Hall over the period of January 2016 to November 2016, and while I&#8217;m not a 100% clear on the translation, it seems that he may have tried this in April 2017 with a Norwegian lodge, or he may have made the threats of extortion from Norway to Denmark at that time, I&#8217;m not sure. It&#8217;s not clear as to whether or not the man was a member of the fraternity, but fortunately it sounds like the charges are for attempted extortion, not successful extortion. The perpetrator has now been extradited to Denmark after being held in Norway following his arrest in Oslo. Best of luck to our Dansk brothers in having a little justice laid down.</em></p>

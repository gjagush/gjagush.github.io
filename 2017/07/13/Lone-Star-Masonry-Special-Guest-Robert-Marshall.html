<p>We had a great stated meeting this Monday. We had 46 or so brothers attend, including a sizable contingent from Oklahoma. We would like to extend our special thanks to them and an extra special thanks to Right Worshipful Deputy Grand Master Corky Grigsby the pleasure of hosting him! Our special congratulations to Brother Namon Kouri, worshipful master of Frederick Lodge #249 under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Oklahoma. Brother Kouri&#8217;s mother lodge is Fort Worth Lodge, and although he had to relocate to Oklahoma, he was able to come down for his 25-year pin! So once again, congrats Brother Kouri. In light of Brother Sam Levisee&#8217;s passing onward and upward into the pearly gates, instead of Masonic education that night, each one of us that knew Sam stood up and told a story about him. It was beautiful. Not a dry eye in the place.</p>

<p><a href="https://lonestarmason.wordpress.com/2017/07/07/masonic-improvement-the-chamber-of-refraction/">Go check out the blog Lone Star Mason by Brother Justin Jones.</a> I&#8217;ve been on a real kick of reading different blog posts by "local" guys, so to speak, ever since Brother Lance Kennedy wrote his <em>10 Propositions for Texas Freemasonry</em>. It seems like there&#8217;s been an increase in writing, sharing, and reading masonic blog posts since that. Anyway, Brother Justin put up a great piece on the Lone Star Mason blog called <em>The Chamber of Refraction</em>, in which he talks about some of the common problems he&#8217;s encountered in the anteroom in which candidates are prepared for degrees. I highly recommend it. Check Brother Justin out at lonestarmason.wordpress.com.</p>

He&#8217;s still a Mason in a few other jurisdictions, so if you were planning on having him come speak at your lodge, you&#8217;ll still be fine. His situation with his Grand Lodge has been resolved, and we wish Brother Hammer the best of luck in his future endeavors.</p>

About a year and a half ago, this guy called Samy Hamzeh was arrested by the FBI on two counts of possessing an illegally-acquired fully-automatic firearm and one count of possessing an illegally-acquired suppressor. He&#8217;s looking at up to 30 years in prison for this. However, now it&#8217;s come out that he bought those from undercover FBI agents, and interestingly enough, he was talked into preparing the attack by FBI informants. One of the informants, called "Mike," is the one who specifically introduced Masons into the equation, telling Hamzeh that Masons were affiliated with ISIS and that Masons were the enemy of Islam and ate human hearts. Now, Hamzeh and his lawyers are pushing for a case of entrapment. Supposedly, the audio transcripts of the phone calls reveal that for a long time, Hamzeh actually repeatedly rejected the ideas that were being pushed on to him. Obviously, this case is still in development, and we&#8217;ll update y&#8217;all as we learn more.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/07/07/anti-trump-graffiti-suspect-indicted/457103001/">Colerain Township, OH</a> - a man is being held on bail after being arrested for two counts of misdemeanor criminal damaging. This guy, Avery Collins, graffittied buildings and cars at two businessess with anti-Trump and anti-Masonic graffiti. He wrote things like "Kill Free Masons," "Kill Freemasons ASAP," and "Black Lifes matter Bitches Burn Trump with all Crackers." Pretty scary stuff - take care out there, brothers. By the way, to the conspiracy theorists and/or anyone wondering: I&#8217;d like to point out that Masons aren&#8217;t affiliated with any one politician, or any one party.</p>

<p>Brothers, it&#8217;s July. That means that somewhere, near you, a lodge is having their installation of officers. Go to it! Support your local lodges. Heck, if you have travel, go support some non-local lodges! Leadership is a challenge and having people show up to welcome you into it is very reassuring.</p>

<p>August 12 - Thomas B Hunter Lodge #1356 in Grand Prairie will be hosting the Julian Feild Players! The Players will be putting on the play, "A Rose Upon the Altar"  on Saturday, August 12, from 10 AM to noon. "A Rose Upon the Altar" is a play about a Lodge in 1939 that is struggling financially and trying to figure out how to keep their lodge going, and continue the chairty work that the community needs. The event is open to the public. I didn&#8217;t see any admission prices, and it&#8217;s listed as "free to all," but since lunch will follow the play, I would personally urge y&#8217;all to bring a little donation to help offset the costs of hospitality.</p>

<a href="http://freemasoninformation.com/2013/12/a-interview-with-arturo-dehoyos/">I believe that my role is to preserve and disseminate Masonic light and knowledge. One of the things I’ve tried to do is publish and/or write books which I wish had existed when I was a younger Mason. It was well-nigh impossible to find some of the things I’ve published when I was younger.</a>

<p>It&#8217;s been a good while since I last posted something regularly, hasn&#8217;t it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Life has been pretty good - if somewhat challenging - since I last made a normal post (instead of a podcast outline). In terms of my career, personal life, and Masonic involvement, everything is pretty different. Let&#8217;s talk about that. One big update, all at once, to get things out of the way.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_career_stuff">Career Stuff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m unemployed at the present moment. I got laid off at the end of this August and have been job hunting since then. Well, actually, I started job hunting well before then, but you get the idea. I got a nice severance package, and I have savings, so I&#8217;m okay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main challenge that I have been experiencing is just getting to the job interview. A lot of times, it doesn&#8217;t go any further than the application - and then the inevitable rejection comes. The second challenge lies in the fact that I majored in a few narrow field of study - petroleum engineering. Granted, my career experience is primarily computer simulation engineering, which is a pretty transferable skill, but I think a lot of non-Oil &amp; Gas companies see "reservoir engineering" and "petroleum engineering" and figure that they&#8217;re better off with not having to train a guy from scratch. It&#8217;s a misconception that I can&#8217;t really fault them for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m staying positive and I&#8217;m continuing to work hard. The simple reality is that in the 2010s, it is taking people longer to find work after a layoff than ever. The key is persistence and patience. I&#8217;ve had a few good job interviews recently - let&#8217;s see where this goes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important thing about the whole experience is how much love and support that I&#8217;ve received, which has made a huge difference. This leads me to&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_personal_stuff">Personal Stuff</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m dating a wonderful gal right now. Sarah and I started dating in February, and have been going steady ever since. She&#8217;s just as much of a nerd as I am and I&#8217;m crazy about her. She has been incredibly supportive during this period of unemployment, and I honestly think I wouldn&#8217;t be doing nearly as well (mentally) if I didn&#8217;t have her to lean on for support. I owe her a ton of thanks. The guys at Lodge keep teasing me about how we&#8217;re gonna be the lodge&#8217;s "2018 Marriage." I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there&#8217;s a betting pool of some kind going on. All I&#8217;ve got to say on the subject is that it&#8217;s a little too early to talk about it, but that I&#8217;m totally fine with keeping her around for a long time (and I hope she feels the same way).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My father hasn&#8217;t been in the best of health. He&#8217;s doing much, much better now, but he&#8217;s been fighting cancer. He developed a bizarre form of appendiceal cancer which herniated and grew all the way to his knee - the doctors had never seen anything like it. They hacked most of it out from his leg and abdomen, but they had to leave a bunch of it in his hip. Right now, they can&#8217;t take what&#8217;s in his hip without an at-the-hip amputation, which Dad understandably wants no part of. Fortunately (thanks be to God) the cancer isn&#8217;t growing or metastasizing. It&#8217;s just kinda&#8230;&#8203; there. For now the game plan / best reasonably possible outcome is that Dad goes in for a scan every few months, the cancer never grows, and Dad simply just has cancer until he dies in a freak Christmas tree accident at the ripe old age of 103. I pray for him and my mom often. She&#8217;s a saint, for a host of reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m surrounded by new friends. Hopefully they last a lifetime. I knew that I&#8217;d be meeting people through Masonry and make a few friends - but I didn’t' expect to make <em>so many.</em> It goes without saying (as anyone in the Fraternity knows) that there&#8217;s too many of them to list on here. All I can say within a reasonable amount of time is: my brothers, it&#8217;s been a pleasure to get to know y&#8217;all and I love y&#8217;all. I am excited about all of my adventures to come.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m also surrounded by old friends. One of the things that I will never not be thankful for is the Internet. Without it, my friends from college and I wouldn&#8217;t be able to stay in touch as well as we do right now. It&#8217;s so comforting to be able to reach out to them and talk - it&#8217;s like they&#8217;re just on the other side of town and we&#8217;re texting to hang out later. I have a few pilgrimages I need to make to the Houston area - it&#8217;s been a while since most of us were physically present together. Time to fix that!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m also grateful for my closest canine companion, Lyra. She&#8217;s my little old lady (11 years old). She&#8217;s a black lab with a heart of gold. During the summers, she&#8217;s been an excellent companion for long, leisurely walks, and now that it&#8217;s the winter, she&#8217;s a great companion for brisk, determined walks. Right now she&#8217;s hunkered down on my bed, enjoying the warm comforter. In a bit, I&#8217;m going to go grab a cigar and we&#8217;ll go for a nice walk, after which we&#8217;ll both retire to the couch and cuddle up for warmth. I love this dog.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hoo boy. There&#8217;s a lot to unpack here. Let&#8217;s break it down into categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_symbolic_lodge">Symbolic Lodge</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am not an officer in my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/fortworthlodge148/">Symbolic Lodge</a>, but I&#8217;ve been having a blast. I do a lot of our degree lectures, and I often pro-tem the Senior Deacon position for degrees and Stated Meetings. I didn&#8217;t accomplish my goal of learning the A-certificate material by the end of the year, because although I know all of the C-certificate material (trial lectures, opening/closing) and I know the lectures, I still haven&#8217;t learned how to confer. My goal is to learn to confer the degrees, and start helping our degree team even more by increasing my versatility.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_chapter_council">Chapter &amp; Council</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wow, where do I start here? "Hold my beer" is super applicable in this case. I started this Capitular/Cryptic year by being installed as an appointed junior officer - Master of the 2nd Veil in Chapter, and Steward in Council. Then, our 2nd-in-command (Excellent King in Chapter and Right Illustrious Deputy Master in Council) had to move to West Virginia. This left us with a gap&#8230;&#8203; and I got promoted to fill it. By dispensation from the respective Grand bodies, we held an election and then installed several officers out-of-time. I am now serving as the Excellent King in Chapter and the Right Illustrious Deputy Master in Council, and am preparing for the year that I serve in the East. It&#8217;s been a blast, and I&#8217;m nervous, but I have a lot of great guys to rely on. One of the things that I am trying to implement is a five-year plan agreed on by the Chapter/Council as a group, so that all the guys that come after me can continue working on something they were a part of designing. The year that I serve will mostly consist of setting up the dominoes for other Companions - and I&#8217;m okay with that. Seeing the continued success of our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TexasChapterAndCouncil/">Chapter/Council</a> is an exciting prospect.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_commandery">Commandery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yesterday, I was installed as the Junior Warden (5th in command) of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/WorthCommandery/">Worth Commandery #19, Knights Templar.</a> I&#8217;m honored to have been elected and installed, and I hope to serve my fellow Sir Knights as best as I can. The Junior Warden part is really a crazy mountain to climb as brand-new SK, but the mountain is there, so I must climb it. I am very excited about bringing the Christian Orders of Knighthood to my Brothers and Companions. Commandery is a very meaningful organization to me. The ritual is so striking, and resonates so strongly with my faith, that I can&#8217;t help but love it. I am very excited to continue exploring the Christian side of Masonry.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_scottish_rite">Scottish Rite</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a Scottish Rite Mason now! I went through the Fall 2017 Reunion and am now a proud Master of the Royal Secret and member of the Fort Worth A&amp;ASR-SJ Valley. It was a grueling 3-weekend process, and I&#8217;m still digesting. Fortunately, I have plenty of reading material to catch up on&#8230;&#8203; and another degree to learn! I got together with some other brothers and we&#8217;re assembling a degree team for the 13th degree - the Royal Arch of Enoch. I&#8217;m excited about it!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I did, however, turn down a petition for the Knights of Saint Andrew. Right now, I want to focus on the York Rite (Symbolic lodge inclusive), and I know that if I get involved with KoSA, I&#8217;ll get carried away. I&#8217;d like to get through the East in Chapter/Council at least, first. This is one of those inevitable things, so never fear, Knights.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_fort_worth_148_podcast">The Fort Worth #148 Podcast</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Man, oh man, has this podcast been a blast. I&#8217;m super thankful that we&#8217;re on holiday break, though. I love the podcast, but it has definitely been taxing time-wise. This has been such an amazing opportunity for self-education and excellent conversation - I love it. I&#8217;ve been really getting the art of editing the podcast in a timely manner down as a strong skill, but I need to work on it - can&#8217;t stay up late all the time! I am looking forwards to next year. We&#8217;ll be cutting down our releases to two episodes per month. This way, we can focus on bringing higher-quality content to our listeners, while giving ourselves some breathing room. I&#8217;d rather release two great 1.5 hour episodes per month than 4-5 okay ones. It&#8217;s gonna be great, so stay tuned.</p>

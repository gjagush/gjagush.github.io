:hp-alt-title: Second Podcast Episode

Second episode is up! It's a triple-threat this week at the Fort Worth 148 Podcast as Brothers Rhit Moore, Grant Gates, and Gabriel Jagush talk about guarding the West Gate. It's not fun to say, but masonry isn't for everyone. How do you best get to know the man you want to call brother? Is he the right fit for Freemasonry, and is Freemasonry the right fit for him? How do you investigate him? These are all questions we explore in this episode. We also briefly touch on the issues our Italian brothers are experiencing, and the Florida/Cuba Grand Lodge drama. At the end of the episode, we have an update on events in and around us, so if you're short on time, but want to know what's going on in the 64th district, please check out the last few minutes of the podcast and we'll get you updated.

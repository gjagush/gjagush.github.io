:hp-alt-title: Sixth Podcast Episode

I'm actually not sure that I posted the fifth episode of the podcast here. Not a huge deal since that's an automatic deal! Here is the sixth episode.

On this week's fireside chat, Brothers Rhit Moore, Grant Gates, and Gabriel Jagush are joined by a special guest: Brother Junior Warden Will Weir of Fort Worth #148! Brother Will is the head of the 148 degree team. What are the benefits of a degree team? Who needs to get involved? How should you approach running and maintaining a team? D'ya got a fancy look? These questions and more get tackled in this episode as Will gives us some insight. Thanks for listening!

Main discussion starts at around 11:37 and local events listing starts at 1:29:30.

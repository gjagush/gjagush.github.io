Wow, what a wild ride. I had been given some "hints" regarding the Council degrees, but I still wasn't prepared. The Royal Master degree in particular was very beautiful! The solemnity of the soliloquiy gave me shivers. There's a lot that I would like to discuss, but unfortunately most all of that is stuff that I can't talk about publicly! It was a great experience and I'm still digesting it, so to speak.

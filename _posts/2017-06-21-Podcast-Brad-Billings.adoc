* Did you have any (maybe even many!) Masonic relatives?
** Did you have any favorites?

* What officer positions (Blue Lodge, Grand Lodge) do you currently hold?

==== That Whole "Religion" Thing

* As a Mason, you definitely believe in some form of higher power, but can you tell us a little bit more specifically about your spiritual and/or religious beliefs?
* Texas requires Masons to believe in "the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the Divine authenticity of the Holy Scripture." Most Grand Jurisdictions require less, a small number require more. What are your thoughts on this?

* How was your experience as High Priest & Thrice Illustrious Master of Love Field Chapter & Council?
* Unlike Scottish Rite, York Rite seems to be having a tough go of it and it seems to hit Chapters & Councils the hardest. What do you think is the key to revitalizing these two bodies?

** What led you becoming a district deputy for Chapter and district deputy for Council?

* You definitely dedicated some time to AMD and are now a Past Sovereign Master. What is it about AMD that called you to leadership there?
** What has been your favorite experience in AMD?
** Is AMD intended to have a larger impact on Masonry as a whole, or is it more of a quiet preservation effort? (I'm not sure if this is the right question to ask, actually)

** Can you tell us about chartering the San Jacinto Monument Assemblage?
* You were recently invested with the VIIÂ° Adeptus Exemptus (7th Grade, Adeptus Extremus) in the Texas College of SRICF. What does that mean in terms of responsibilites? Is that like recieving a degree for knowledge, or is that a chair degree?
** Do you have any recommendations for people who are looking to learn more about Rosicrucianism, or any book recommendations on Rosicrucian teachings?
* In your opinion, should Masonic invitational bodies be more restrictive, or less restrictive?

== Quote

"https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=pu45AQAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&output=reader&hl=en&pg=GBS.PA43[When I am employed in serving others, I do not look upon myself as conferring favors, but as paying debts. I have received much kindness from men to whom I shall never have an opportunity of making the least direct returns; and numberless mercies from God, who is infinitely above being benefited by our services. Those kindnesses from men I can, therefore, only return on their fellow-men, and I can only show my gratitude for those mercies from God by a readiness to help His other children.]"
-- Right Worshipful Brother Benjamin Franklin, May 17th entry in Poor Richard Day by Day
